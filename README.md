<h1 align="center" id="title">Map Geolocation App</h1>

<p id="description">
  
  This educational project was completed as part of studies at Geekbrains. Application written in Kotlin. The application utilizes Yandex MapKit to display maps. It identifies the user's location through geolocation. Users can also interact with the map by clicking to place markers which they can label and comment on. There's also a screen to display a list of all markers on the map with the ability to edit them and quickly transition the camera view by clicking on an item in the list. All markers previously set by the user are saved to the application's database and are loaded upon subsequent launches of the application.</p>
